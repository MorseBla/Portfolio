            <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was created in October 2022 
            during the Ohio State University’s Hackathon. The user uploads a 
            video of a dance or exercise that they wish to replicate. Then the 
            application uses a camera to give feedback based on how similar the 
            body movements are between the two video sources.</p>

            <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just Dance - TikTok 
            Edition uses the TensorFlow pose estimation API to get the locations 
            of specific body parts on both the provided video and the user. The 
            application then uses a handful of algorithms to determine an 
            “accuracy score.” The application then tells the user if their 
            movements are ok, good, great, or perfect based on the score.</br>
            </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This application was 
            created in less than 24 hours as a fun project for three engineering 
            students to learn and showcase their coding skills.</p>

            <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Braille Teaching 
            Device was made during the Fundamentals of Engineering II class at 
            The Ohio State University in the spring of 2022. The device is made 
            out of an Arduino Nano, a mini-MP3 player, a speaker, push-buttons, 
            and 3D printed parts.</p>

            <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user spins the 
            three rotating components to create a braille letter and then 
            presses them forward. The device then audibly announces the letter 
            created by the user. In an alternate mode, toggled via a button on 
            the back, the device prompts the user to input a letter and then 
            announces whether the letter they submitted is correct.</br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of 
            the electronic components were provided by the university, but the 
            conception, design, 3D printing, wiring, soldering, coding, and 
            assembly were all done by the students.</br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This product works 
            by reading the dots on the back side of the spinning components. 
            By design, the “letter” on the back is the inverse of what can be 
            seen on the front. Any number of the six push buttons can be 
            triggered depending on how many dots are present on the back side. 
            The location of these dots is then put through an algorithm to 
            detect the letter.</br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Braille 
            Teaching Device was given the second-place award among all 
            projects created by students taking this class.</p>

            <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MATLAB Tetris was 
            created as a project for the Fundamentals of Engineering I class at 
            The Ohio State University in the fall of 2021. The university 
            provided a simple game engine, but all other work was done by the 
            students. The program has nearly 2000 lines of code and the 
            gameplay is seamless and similar to the original Tetris game. 
            This program includes a soundtrack, handmade graphics, an 
            intriguing title screen, a score tracker, and an impressive AI 
            opponent.</br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program also 
            contains multiple game modes, including single-player, multiplayer, 
            and single-player vs. AI.</p>

            <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TikTok Tutor is a 
            progressive web app that was created during the Ohio State 
            Hackathon, HackOhio, in October of 2023. TikTok Tutor is an 
            educational social media post generator.</p>

            <p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user inputs any 
            topic into the dedicated input and then the program prompts ChatGPT 
            for funny, interesting, and educational messages, relating to the 
            topic, that mimic Reddit, Twitter, or 4Chan. Then the program 
            creates a “post” that looks like a social media post. TikTok Tutor 
            continuously generates posts so that the user can always scroll 
            down to see another post about the topic.</br></br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project was coded in Python and uses 
            CSS, Flask, and ChatGPT’s API. The members working on front-end 
            spent much time making each individual “post” look similar to their 
            social media counterpart. Time was also spent creating prompts for 
            ChatGPT so that its output is educational and mimics social media.
